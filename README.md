## Hi there 👋
Hello stranger, I'm just an ordinary Joe, honored that you've stumbled upon me (though it's all rather pointless).

I admit, this intro's probably about as weird as it gets, considering I don't know English from a hole in the ground. So, yeah, all of this is just some software's doing, including my name, which is supposed to sound like /ˈkæɪ̯mi ɑˈmu/. 🙄✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on _embracing the chaos that is my terrible life_.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning _how to avoid nightmares_. 💤
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on _making cookies_ 🍪 _(I'll handle the tasting part)_.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with _finding legitimate excuses to stay in bed all day_.
- 💬 Ask me about _why I'm somewhat of a ditz – it's a long story_.
- 📫 How to reach me: <cmyamx@163.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: _it (as in, a single-celled organism)_.
- ⚡ Fun fact: _I can't code; I just know how to use AI to make it look like I do_.
